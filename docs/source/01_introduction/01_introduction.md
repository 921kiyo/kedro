# Introduction

## What is Kedro?

Kedro is an open source development workflow framework that implements software engineering best-practice for data pipelines with an eye towards productionising machine learning models.

You can use Kedro with a wide range of projects, from organising a single user project running on a local environment, up to enterprise-level collaborative projects that need to optimise the process of taking a machine learning model into a production environment.

For the source code, take a look at the [Kedro repository on Github](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro).

## Learning about Kedro

In the next few chapters, you will learn how to [install](../02_getting_started/01_prerequisites.md) and set up Kedro to build your own production-ready data pipelines.

Once you are set up, to get a feel for Kedro, we suggest working through our examples, including:

-   An entry-level description of the main concepts in ["Hello Kedro"](../02_getting_started/04_hello_kedro.md)
-   A first [example using the familiar Iris dataset](../02_getting_started/05_example_project.md) to introduce the Kedro project template
-   A more detailed ["Spaceflights" tutorial](../03_tutorial/02_tutorial_template.md) to give you hands-on experience as you learn about Kedro

Advanced users looking for in-depth information should consult the [User Guide](../04_user_guide/03_configuration.md).

You can also check out the resources section for answers to [frequently asked questions](../06_resources/01_faq.md) and the [API reference documentation](/kedro.rst) to find further information.

## Assumptions

Our goal is to help you get started and create your own Kedro projects in Python. We have designed the documentation and the [Spaceflights tutorial](../03_tutorial/02_tutorial_template.md) for anyone new to Kedro. The more knowledge of Python you have, the easier you will find the learning curve.

> *Note:* There are a number of excellent online resources for learning Python, but be aware that you should choose those that reference Python 3, as Kedro is built for Python 3.6+. There are many curated lists of online resources, such as:

> -   [List of free programming books and tutorials](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md#python)
